# Project Ideas

Making a project - (and adding to that project over time) - is really the best
way to learn.  You're forced to:
- Encounter problems to solve that aren't textbook problems
- Look up possible solutions, choose one, and implement
- Encounter errors / exceptions / bugs, and work around them
- Learn a million things you wouldn't have learned just doing tutorials
