## This GitHub Account
This GitHub account will be used for collaborative projects within Cardinal Peak's QA team.  We will put our programming into practice and collaborate in a real git-powered team environment.  With this we can do a couple things:
* Work on projects as a team
* Share our own work and get feedback from other QA team members
* Share useful resources / links / etc.


## This "Hello Team" Repo
This "Hello Team" repo is just a landing page.  Here we can collect ideas for things we might want to create as a team.
